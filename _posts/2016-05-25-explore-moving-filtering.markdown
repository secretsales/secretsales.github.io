I've never really been a big fan of the refinements menu on our listings page. It is a good way of organising the many many products we have but at times it can be a bit difficult to use.

Other issues include:

* It's buggy on mobile devices and tablets.
* It can be pretty sprawling and messy on some categories (see sizes in outlet, MASSIVE LIST).

I had a quick jaunt over to other e-commerce fashion type sites to see what solutions other tech folk have come up with.

[River Island](http://www.riverisland.com/women/dresses/_/N-7zk?icid=mu/women/dresses) (left) and [Top Shop](http://www.topshop.com/en/tsuk/category/clothing-427/dresses-442/N-85cZdgl?Nf=nowPrice%7CBTWN%2B65.0%2B145.0&No=0&Nrpp=20&siteId=%2F12556) (right) both of them using accordion style menus, personally I'm not a big fan of these, I can see why though, it saves on space but usually listings pages are notoriously long so why hide items on pages that have enough space for them, you're forcing the user to click more than they have to.

Both of these case studies, as well as most other sites and even past employers of mine (RIP comet) seem to use max and min price sliders, these look pretty common practice now, so I'll probably throw them into the prototype.

Quite like the use of [Asos's](http://www.asos.com/women/jumpsuits-playsuits/cat/pgecategory.aspx?cid=7618&via=top) refinements below. All out and no pesky accordion. Although they have limited themselves somewhat as the menu gets fixed as you scroll so you can only fit so many options in until the rest are unreachable. Why you do this Asos? Why?

<img src="/post-img/asos-mobile-refinements.png" style="float: left;  left; padding: 0 20px;">

Asos mobile version is very clean and clutter free but involves a lot of clicks to get through, I've included the process here, could this be done in a better more intuitive way?

After the extensive research this is the prototype I've come up with. For full page view click [here](http://codepen.io/gurprit/full/vGbOWM/){:target="_blank"}.
