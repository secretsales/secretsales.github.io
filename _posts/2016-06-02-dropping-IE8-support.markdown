Good news everybody!! (for FE DEVs anyway)

We're dropping support for IE8!
<!--more-->

From a recent git comment

>Are we supporting IE8?  ..... IE is only 4.67% (May 2nd to 1st June from Google Analytics) of which IE8 is 4.38% of the 4.67% total so it's very negligible, I think it's time we drop IE8 support, best to talk to product about it.

Product said yes, drop it, so no more browser compatibility tests for IE8!!
